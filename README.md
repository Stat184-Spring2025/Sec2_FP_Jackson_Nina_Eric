# Historical Analysis of Olympic Data

This repository is exploring different aspects of Olympic competition data. The data files include information on individual competitors in Olympics dating from 1896-2016, giving over 120 years of data.

## Overview

The main data file, athlete_events.csv contains information on individual athletes who competed in Olympic Games. A case is a single athlete, in a single event, in a single year. This means that there is data on athletes who have competed in several Olympic Games and several events. Each case has 15 variables: ID, Name, Sex, Age, Height, Weight, Team, NOC, Games, Year, Season, City, Sport, Event, and Medal. 

We decided to focus more on quantifiable data, such as Age, Height, and Weight, for further analysis. 

### Interesting Insight

This is optional but highly recommended. You'll include one interesting insight from your project as part of the README. This insight is most effective when you include a visual. Keep in mind that this visual must be included as an image file (e.g., JPG, PNG, etc.). You can export plots created with `{ggplot2}` by using the function `ggsave`.
